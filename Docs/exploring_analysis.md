# Exploratory Analysis
The Exploratory Analysis would expand upon 
# Where did we start (Comparison of variables) (Correlation model)
* Firstly, we need to know whether the dataset is stationary.
  * We used the Dickey-Fuller Test to determined stationarity.
* Secondly, whether the dataset had any seasonality.
  * We used the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) to determined seasonality.
* Once we determined the factors above, we had to find the moving average of our dataset.
  * To determined the trend that out dataset is heading towards.
* Next step was to apply differencing to make the dataset stationary.
# How did we come to use ARIMA/LSTM (Moving Average)
* 
# Concept of Moving Average
Using Moving Average we are able to tell the trend in which our dataset is trending towards. As it captures the average change in our data over time.
* An upwards trend shows an upswing in the price
* A downwards trend shows a decline in the price
# Explain the concept of use of neural network
# Why did we choose ARIMA and LSTM (Advantages of using them over Moving Average)
