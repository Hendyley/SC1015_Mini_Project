# Exploratory Analysis
The Exploratory Analysis would expand upon 
# Where did we start (Comparison of variables) (Correlation model)
* Firstly, we need to know whether the dataset is stationary.
** We used the Dickey-Fuller Test to determined stationarity.
* Secondly, whether the dataset had any seasonality.
** We used the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) to determined seasonality
* Once we determined the factors above, we had to find the moving average of our dataset.
** To determined the trend that out dataset is heading towards
# How did we come to use ARIMA/LSTM (Moving Average)
# Explain the concept of Moving Average
# Explain the concept of use of neural network
# Why did we choose ARIMA and LSTM (Advantages of using them over Moving Average)
