# Exploratory Analysis
The Exploratory Analysis would expand upon how we applied the ARIMA into our time series model.

# Where did we start


# Concept of Moving Average
Using Moving Average we are able to tell the trend in which our dataset is trending towards. As it captures the average change in our data over time.
* An upwards trend shows an upswing in the price
* A downwards trend shows a decline in the price

Therefore, using Moving Average we are able to tell beforehand whether the stock price is trending upwards or downwards which would help in our prediction.

# How did we come to use ARIMA

# Why did we choose ARIMA

(Nid segue to algorithm optimization --> use of ARIMA + GARCH)
