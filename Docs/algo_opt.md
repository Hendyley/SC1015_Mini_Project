# Optimization of Algorithm
 * Explain the concept of GARCH (Within the ARIMA-GARCH Prediction)/Can link from there
 * Explain why choose GARCH (To measure volatility in additional to the price prediction)
 * Further Optimization Algorithm
   * Use other predictor with the addition of history of pricing
   * Classification
     * Checking the correlation of a positive news and price increase
   * Use of Neural Network
     * Explain the concept of Recurring Neural Network
     * Use of LSTM
     * Brief explanation of [LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
