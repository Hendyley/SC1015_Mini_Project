# Comparison of Models (ARIMA-GARCH VS LSTM VS Classification)

## ARIMA-GARCH

## LSTM

### Approach to LSTM

## Classification

### Assumptions

### Drawbacks

## Suggestions

# Conclusion

In this project, we have come to the conclusion that our approach to the movement of stocks is too naive, only capable to predict the movement with some accuracy.

However, it still can be further improved with additional knowledge of ML and Neural Network.<br/>
